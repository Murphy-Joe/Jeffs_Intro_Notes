## Stuff you Asked For
- Docker/Kubernetes (coming next week!)

## Topics
- Stored Procedures (barf)

- **INTERFACES**
    - Types / Methods / Polymorphism
    - LSP
> An Interface is a group of related methods that form a *contract* between the class(es) that implements that interface and the code that needs that functionality. When a class implements an interface, it is saying "I can do that stuff". A method that can take an argument of an interface type and *any* object that is from a class that implements that interface can be passed to that method. It is more flexible than inheriting from a class, because you can only inherit from one class, but you can implement a bunch of interfaces. (Joe implements the dad, the programmer, the browns fan, and the great dancer interfaces, for example. They don't *define* him, but he can do those things.)

(forget all that "implementing abstractly* stuff if you want.)
